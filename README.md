# indeed-common-words

This repo contains two scripts one that searches through indeed and checks the number of jobs each word in a text file and graphs the most common one. <strong>(Common jobs.py)</strong>

The other script searches a generic term (software in this case) and goes through all the pages and graphs the most common words found (while filtering out stopwords). <strong>(Common words.py)</strong>

Both scripts contain random sleeps to prevent too many requests being sent in a short space of time.
